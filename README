CVars is a small C++ library that allows run-time tweaking of variables.

Within CVars, GLConsole is an example that allows OpenGL developers to easily
add a 'Quake-style' debugging console to their applications.  GLConsole relies
on CVars.

A short list of features:

- Any variable in your code can easily be exposed for tweaking from the console.
- New object types to be easily exposed in the console (just overload << and >>)
- Full and partial tab completion with suggestions and commmand history
- Scrolling with shift+up/shift+down and page-up/page-down.
- Printf style logging functions to send any error or status messages to the
  console
- Custom console functions that take an arbitrary number of parameters allow
  the console to perform arbitrary tasks


To use the GLUT interface, just include <GLConsole/GLConsole.h>.   See the demo
in the Example directory to see how use GLConsole with GLUT.

To use the FLTK interface, just include <FLConsole/FLConsole.h>.   See the demo
in the Example directory to see how use FLConsole with FLTK.
