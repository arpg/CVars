CVars is a small C++ library that allows run-time tweaking of C++ variables.

GLConsole is a header written C++ designed to allow developers to easily add a
'Quake-style' debugging console to their applications.  GLConsole relies on CVars.

A short list of features:

- Any variable in your code can easily be exposed for tweaking from the console.
- New object types to be easily exposed in the console (just overload << and >>)
- Full and partial tab completion with suggestions and commmand history
- Scrolling with shift+up/shift+down and page-up/page-down.
- Printf style logging functions to send any error or status messages to the
  console
- Custom console functions that take an arbitrary number of parameters allow
  the console to perform arbitrary tasks

After building and installing CVars, you can use it by linking against
libcvars.

To use the GLUT interface, just include <GLConsole/GLConsole.h>.   See the demo
in the Example directory to see how use GLConsole with GLUT.

To use the FLTK interface, just include <FLConsole/FLConsole.h>.   See the demo
in the Example directory to see how use FLConsole with FLTK.
